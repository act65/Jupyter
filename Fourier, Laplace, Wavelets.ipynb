    "> Generally speaking, the more concentrated f(x) is, the more spread out its Fourier transform ${\\displaystyle {\\hat {f}}(\\xi )} {\\hat {f}}(\\xi )$ must be. In particular, the scaling property of the Fourier transform may be seen as saying: if we \"squeeze\" a function in x, its Fourier transform \"stretches out\" in $\\xi$. It is not possible to arbitrarily concentrate both a function and its Fourier transform."
