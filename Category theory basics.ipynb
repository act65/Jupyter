    "Just some notes from learning about category theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview/thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like category theory is a language of coeenctions. ??\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monoids\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a group without the requirement of inverse elements.\n",
    "So a monoid is not closed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, very abstract definition. It seems like a category can be anything that has objects and connections between those objects. Feels very similar to graph theory, with edges and verticies.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Virtually every branch of modern mathematics can be described in terms of categories_\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this such a nice abstraction? We see edges/verticies/nodes/links/weights/neurons/objects/morphisms/... coming up all the time. What is so natural about points and arrows?\n",
    "\n",
    "* it is a universal language (?)\n",
    "* easy to visualise/compare structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let C be a category, then\n",
    "\n",
    "* obj(C) is the set of objects in C\n",
    "* hom(C) is the set of morphisms\n",
    "* composition\n",
    "* identity\n",
    "* associativity\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is it so general/abstract that it doesnt really tell us anything...? Or too powerful so that it can do everything and thus nothing. Like string theory? Or any suitably abstract and ambiguious idea/framework.\n",
    "* Do the morphisms need to be surjective,..,cts?\n",
    "* Hmm. So a category is not closed (?)\n",
    "* How is this different to a type? [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-category-theory-and-type-theory)\n",
    "* If we have the category Vec which has vector spaces as its objects linear maps as its morphisms. Then what is NonLinVec, the category with non-linear maps as its morphisms?\n",
    "* \n",
    "\n",
    "### Morphisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmmm, this is interesing. An exploration of different types of morphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <i> A morphism f : a → b is called\n",
    "* a monomorphism (or monic) if fg1 = fg2 implies g1 = g2 for all morphisms g1, g2 : x → a.\n",
    "* an epimorphism (or epic) if g1f = g2f implies g1 = g2 for all morphisms g1, g2 : b → x.\n",
    "* a bimorphism if it is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism.\n",
    "* a retraction if it has a right inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism g : b → a with fg = 1b.\n",
    "* a section if it has a left inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism g : b → a with gf = 1a.\n",
    "* an isomorphism if it has an inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism g : b → a with fg = 1b and gf = 1a.\n",
    "* an endomorphism if a = b. The class of endomorphisms of a is denoted end(a).\n",
    "* an automorphism if f is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. The class of automorphisms of a is denoted aut(a). </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes you wonder what different types of connection and objects there are. \n",
