### Intro

The introduction to the course. What is machine learning, some applications and how are we going to come at it. What are we going to learn and how are we going to be assesed.

##### Thoughts

I liked;
* that you ran the course outline past us, and let us/asked us to give some input. It felt like we have more of a say in what we are going to learn and how. I feel empowered. (dont know if this was by design or disorganisation... but it was good)
* Getting two people to lecture the class tomorrow. Sets a great precedent for; diving into new topics, not feeling pressure to be great, ...?

Improvements(?);
* Could have done with more inspiration. Interesting point you made "_ I dont want to act as a repository for interesting resources, as I want others to go out and find it._" Chicken and egg problem? Need to inspire them first, so they will be motivated to find interesting stuff?
* Get to know class members? Everyone introduces themselves? Why are they taking the course?
