The numerator of 10(5/13) is 50, and 50 ≡ 11 mod 13, so 50/13 = 11/13 + integer. Since we already saw that 50/13 = 3.846153, the integer part of 50/13 is 3 and therefore 11/13 = .846153. In other words, shifting the digits in .384615 one position to the left turns 5/13 into 11/13, and the reason is that shifting digits in a decimal one position to the left corresponds to multiplication by 10 and 5 · 10 ≡ 11 mod 13.\n",
