### Summary

Three parts

* The brain optimizes cost functions
* Cost functions are diverse across areas and change over development
* Specialized systems allow efficiently solving key computational problems



### The brain optimises cost functions

Simpler cost functions provided by evolution as a good init/prior. Until we can learn better ones?




### Optimization occurs in the context of specialized structures

If we consider the specialised structutres of a computer for a second, we have the CPU, the RAM, memory, ... maybe a GPU, ???. Much like a brain has hard suited for different jobs: ???, ???, ???

The ability to design hardware?


### 

> At the level of learning rules, the brain solves an optimization problem in a highly nonlinear, non-differentiable, temporally stochastic,

Hmmm...


Cool ideas
* A set of specialized optimisers for ???
* A set of different loss functions for different data
* Learning/adapting loss functions?
* Heirachical loss functions and optimisation <- dynamics of this
*
