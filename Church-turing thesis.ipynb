    "What if we had a computer that changed itself in response to a problem. The a naive simulation would be for the turning machine to encode each change, rather than the process behind it. So what I an saying is that; It is possible to do much worse than constant, depending on how you simulate.\n",

    "Wait a minute. Turing machines dont count the time it takes to look up an action given their state (???). It is just assumed to cost 1. But this means we could create an infinite table of if-then statements. But this isnt feasible in reality as we still have to search through each if-then to find the right one. So An algorithms complexity should also depend on ???.\n",
