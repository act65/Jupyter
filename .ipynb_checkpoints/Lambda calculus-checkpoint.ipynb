    "Ok, this is pretty cool. We have removed the representation (now as functions) from what they actually are (numbers). So we have abstracted away from the integers and we are really talking about ordered sequences. But we have represented them as the nested/recursive calling of some (zero?) function. No, we haven't, as we are not actually calling/applying the function. It is just an abstract definition, that an algorithm called recursively ..?\n",
