    "What about problems outside of NP? The one where it is hard to even verify correct answers (e.g. best next move in chess, .. ?). Are there any problems where it is faster to find a solution than to verify it? (this doesnt make any sense... a paradox) Hmm, easy to check wrong answers\n",

    "> If P=NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in “creative leaps,” no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it's found. Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss; everyone who could recognize a good investment strategy would be Warren Buffett.\n",
