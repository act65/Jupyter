# Prediction and learning

The rate of learning is important. The resource we are tracking is mistakes. E.g. polynomial time algorithms, sub linear error!

Experts = bandit (but with less info?) - partial information (like reinformcement learning)
Bandit, you have to explore.

Upper connfidence bound (or UC tree) leads to? -> monte carlo tree search
